## Usage

(see sample Xcode project in `/Demo`)

Just like any UIViewController, VXPromotionViewController can be pushed into a UINavigationController stack:
If you specify your app id, a rating and share button is displayed

```objective-c
VXPromotionViewController *promoViewController = [[VXPromotionViewController alloc] initWithAddress:@"https://www.swift.ch/api/ch/de"];
promoViewController.appID = @"499346672";
[self.navigationController pushViewController:promoViewController animated:YES];
```

It can also be presented modally using `VXPromotionModalViewController`:

```objective-c
VXPromotionModalViewController *promoViewController = [[VXPromotionModalViewController alloc] initWithArrayOfAppIDs:@[@"499346672", @"450499218", @"742018969"]];
promoViewController.appID = @"499346672";
[self presentViewController:promoViewController animated:YES completion:NULL];
```
